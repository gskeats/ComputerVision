Proj3 objective:
-to identify and annotate agricultural activity in satellite data imagery
-try to apply any succesful agricultural classifiers to illegal gold mining since agriculture has more data for training and testing

components: 
-chop large satellite images and identify areas of agricultural activity and an equal number without any activity
-use lbp since agriculture is often identifiable by straight lines/edges that infrequently appear in nature without human intervention
-try HOG since there might be interesting gradient distributions for these images
